- make sure you update plans on adhoc changes not related to plans
- make sure you plan updating documentation when you make changes 
- dont make stuff to long
- practice DRY
- always doublecheck plans if the tasks in plans are completed
- dont put too much files and folders
- simplify stuff to be created
- stick to a standard naming convention
- assume that the other developer is a serial killer
- run aws commands automatically, check outputs and fix by yourself
- if there are any changes requested by the user outside the plan, update the plan, architecture and the readme accordingly
- when running aws commands, make sure not to use pagination so that all outputs are shown
